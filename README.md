# [Project 1: Similarity Scoring College Pitchers](https://medium.com/iowabaseballmanagers/similarity-scoring-college-pitchers-8332fc5860b6)
* Imported and transformed over 150,000 plate appearance events

* Applied pitch usage weighting with Earth Mover's Distance to score arsenals
* Built a Shiny application for staff to use the model

# [Project 2: National Park states invasive fish species populations](https://github.com/apalensky/Invasive_Fish_Project) 
* Imported nearly 120,000 known NationalPark wildlife species from the [National Park Service Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity) and reduced data to to extant fish species
* Scraped additional National Park data from online as well as known fish species non-endemic to each state from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
* Cleaned and joined our scraped data to perform feature exploration
* Choropleth mapped invasive fish species as a percentage of all fish species prevalent in states with National Parks
* Gave a presentation to undergraduate departmental professors on wildlife resource management effectiveness using research on states identified with high invasive ratios
