# Recent projects

## [Project 1: Similarity scoring college pitchers](https://medium.com/iowabaseballmanagers/similarity-scoring-college-pitchers-8332fc5860b6)
* Imported and transformed over 150,000 plate appearance events.
* Generated novel pitch similarity scoring using R and Euclidean Distance.
* Applied pitch usage weighting with Earth Mover's Distance to score arsenals.
* Built a Shiny application for staff to use the model in offseason pitch design.

## Project 2: Product recommendation engine
* Provided data by a beverage distribution company covering 1,500 products, close to 2,500 customers, and more than 8250,000 transactions over the past four years to conduct initial research.
* Removed sparse records and top nationally selling brands from analysis to focus on marketable niche or newer products, broken down by beverage category.
* Captured insights from association rule mining to construct the recommendation engine which returned the top desired number of uncarried products sold at similar businesses or identified as emergent trends in the beverage industry .
* Presented the company with the recommendation engine and a report covering commonly recomended products and how these recommendations varied by customer business category and size.

## [Project 3: National Park states invasive fish species populations](https://github.com/apalensky/Invasive_Fish_Project) 
* Imported nearly 120,000 known NationalPark wildlife species from the [National Park Service Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity) and reduced data to to extant fish species.
* Scraped additional National Park data from online as well as known fish species non-endemic to each state from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
* Cleaned and joined our scraped data to perform feature exploration.
* Choropleth mapped invasive fish species as a percentage of all fish species prevalent in states with National Parks.
* Gave a presentation to undergraduate departmental professors on wildlife resource management effectiveness using research on states identified with high invasive ratios.
